## Team Ownership

```
apps/web/                 — Next.js frontend application
services/reporting/       — Report generation, export
tests/e2e/                — End-to-end tests
docs/product/             — Product documentation
```

## Team Boundaries

### Team 5 OWNS

- All frontend code
- All UI components
- Report generation service
- Report export
- E2E tests
- Product documentation

### Team 5 DOES NOT OWN

- `services/core/` — Team 1
- `services/evidence/` — Team 1
- `packages/schemas/` — Team 1
- `connectors/` — Team 2
- `services/intelligence/` — Team 3
- `services/graph/` — Team 3
- `services/ai/` — Team 4
- `services/verification/` — Team 4

---

## What Team 5 Must NOT Modify

- Core schemas (`packages/schemas/`) without Team 1 review
- Database migrations (Team 1 only)
- Connector implementations (`connectors/`)
- AI agent code (`services/ai/`)
- Entity/graph logic (`services/intelligence/`, `services/graph/`)
- Evidence storage logic (Team 1 only)
- Verification logic (Team 4 only)

## Git Workflow

1. Feature branch from `team/5-product`
2. Implement feature
3. Write tests
4. Self-review
5. PR to `team/5-product`
6. Team lead reviews
7. Merge to `team/5-product`
8. Technical architect reviews `team/5-product` → `main`

**Never push directly to `main`.**

---

## Testing Expectations

- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for API interactions (MSW mocking)
- E2E tests with Playwright (critical user flows)
- Accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Loading/error state tests

---

## Documentation Expectations

- Component documentation
- Page routing guide
- API consumption guide
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guide

---

## Security Rules

- No secrets in frontend code
- No API keys in client-side bundles
- Environment variables for API URL only
- No sensitive data in URLs
- XSS protection via React defaults
- CSRF protection where applicable

---

## AI Coding Rules

- Use OpenCode + Ollama (free/local only)
- No paid AI APIs
- AI explains before modifying
- AI suggests implementation plan first
- Human reviews all AI output
- AI never decides UI/UX alone without human approval
- AI never introduces analytics or tracking without approval

---
