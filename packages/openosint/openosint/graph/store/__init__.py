# openosint/graph/store/__init__.py
"""
Phase 2 — the append-only SQLite store.

Unlike openosint/graph/{mapping,provenance,identity,...}.py (Phase 1, pure,
no I/O), everything under this package performs real file I/O and is
intentionally synchronous — sqlite3 is stdlib-synchronous and fast enough for
local single-file access. Callers on the async side (a future MCP tool in
Phase 4) wrap calls in asyncio.to_thread(), the same pattern search_whois.py
already uses for its own blocking call.
