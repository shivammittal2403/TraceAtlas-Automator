# openosint/graph/store/graph_store.py
"""
The append-only SQLite store. All real I/O for the graph package lives here.

Synchronous by design: sqlite3 is stdlib-synchronous, a single local file is
fast enough that there is nothing to gain from an async wrapper at this
layer, and a synchronous class is far simpler to test. A future async caller
(Phase 4's MCP tools) wraps calls in asyncio.to_thread(), exactly the pattern
openosint/tools/search_whois.py already uses for its own blocking WHOIS call.

Five methods matter most:
  append()            — Phase 1 EmissionResult -> statements/provenance/bridge_links.
  append_resolution()  / canonical_for() / resolution_history() — requirement A.
  erase()              — requirement B, the one hard-delete path.
  neighbors()           — depth-N BFS, cycle-guarded, fan-out capped, cross_layer aware.
