# tests/test_graph_store_erasure.py
"""Tests for GraphStore.erase() — requirement B, the one exception to append-only.

Three layers of proof, weakest to strongest:
  1. SQL queries against the live connection (logical deletion only).
  2. entity_id_for() recomputed from the erased VALUES, checked against every
     table/column — proves no derived id (a confirmation oracle) survives.
  3. Raw bytes of the .db and -wal files opened in binary mode — the only
     test that proves anything about physical, not just logical, erasure.
