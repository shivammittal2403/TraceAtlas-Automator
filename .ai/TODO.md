# Highest-priority TODO

1. Audit case/evidence replay for semantic recomputation and version handling.
2. Verify current source maturity persistence, actor authorization and
   promotion revocation behavior.
3. Map every CLI/API/UI/MCP/worker collection path to the same authority and
   kill switch; close any alternate network paths.
4. Establish staging deployment and tenant/IAM prerequisites before hosting.
5. Build a measured, synthetic golden investigation set before assigning an
   enterprise score.

New connector count is not a priority until existing sources pass the lifecycle
and evidence gates.


## Verified merge repair follow-up — 2026-10-05

PR #56 was merged as `5ad16f01d4e3916dc6f40591c8fcbef2c14c88b8`. Its tree
`ed5a421db97250eadea5e32910c299b871035ac7` equals the downloaded `03fdfd84`
snapshot. A subsequent merge had reintroduced duplicate registry gate definitions,
a malformed conditional and duplicate test fragments. The follow-up changes only
`src/traceatlas/workforce/source_registry.py` and `tests/test_source_fabric.py`
in executable code. Durable workforce runtime and all 26 qualification gates remain.
Negative tests retain unresolved terms, unresolved operational-owner evidence and
stale-state promotion checks.

Full local suite: **372 run, 369 passed, 3 skipped, zero failures** (88.957 seconds).
Compilation of src/tests/api/scripts/vercel_control.py passes; secret scan is clean.
Exact baseline, changed Git blob hashes and test-output hash are recorded in
`docs/verification/source-qualification-followup-2026-10-05.json`.
Earlier 329-test attribution to merged code remains withdrawn. The previous
synthetic benchmark record remains 12 lineage pairs (TP7/FP0/TN5/FN0) and 8
temporal pairs (TP3/FP0/TN5/FN0); these are not field-accuracy measurements.
Hosted checks are pending publication of this follow-up. Enterprise 8/10,
representative evaluation and live-source qualification remain open.
